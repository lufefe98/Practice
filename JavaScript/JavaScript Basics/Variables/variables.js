// JavaScript variables are a way to store data that can be used at a later stage.
// Data can be stored using a statement to declare the variable, the variable name
// an assignment operator and the value (which is the data that is meant to 
// be stored)

// var alert = alert("Hello JavaScript")


// The Var statement is used to declare the variable, "alert" is the variable name
// and the equal sign is the "assignment operator" which assigns the variable name
// "alert" to the value on the opposite side of the operator.

// let alert = alert("Hello world")

// The above case will not work only because the example used above involves an
// alert, but normaly when working with other types of data such as numbers and
// strings, it is possible to assign a new value to a variable name associated
// with let or var

// The let statement is an updated version of var which is part of ES6 JavaScript
// and it differs from Var in that it is only accessible within the variable that
// it is only available inside the block it is defined within, where as var can be
// accessed throughout the function

const userPrompt = prompt("Type your name in here")
// Const is another way of declaring a variable and is different from let and var
// in that it can not be reassigned/updated to another value

// Const is similar to let in that it is only accessible within the block it is
// declared within.



// Variables can be recalled at a later stage by invoking their name in objects, logic
// statements etc.
