                Positioned according to normal document flow and
                offset relative to itself based on top/bottom/left/right

        <!-- 
                * SIDE NOTES *
            Absolutely positioned elements (eg: fixed and absolute) 
            which have any margins will have them added to their 
            left/right or top/bottom properties.

            Absolutely positioned elements that have width and
            height set to auto are sized to fit their contents. However, if
            the element is non-replaced, the top and bottom property can be
            used to fill in the remaining vertical space if height is set
            to auto. The same would apply horizontally for left and right 
            properties.


            If both top and bottom are set to any value other than
            auto, top wins.
            If the language used is ltr (left to right) script then left
            wins, but if it is a rtl script, then right wins.

            ACCESSIBILITY CONCERNS: Make sure absolutely fixed elements do
            not obscure the other content when zooming in to increase
            text size.

            PERFORMANCE CONCERNS: Sticky and fixed elements need
            to repaint at several points on the browser and may be
            slow to do so on some browsers/machines and one fix for this
            can be to use will-change: transform; to render the element in its
            own layer which improves repaint speed and therefore performance
            and accessibility.
