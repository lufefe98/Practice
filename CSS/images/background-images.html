    <h1>Making Transparent Background Image</h1>

           Transparent Background Image
        </h1>

        <p>
          I have been finding it difficult to adjust the opacity of a background image
          which is something I wanted to learn how to do, so I went on the internet
          in search of solutions and what I found from 
          <a href="https://coder-coder.com/background-image-opacity/">

          </a>
          is that you need to use the <span>::before</span> psuedo element on the element you
          want to set it on and include the background image on the
          psuedo element of the parent element.
          <br>
          Once you have done this you need to position it absolutely and
          then give the top, bottom, left and right proprties a value of 
          0 and then set the content property.
          <br>
          It is also important to set the elements that will be above the
          background image to relative to prevent them from being overlayed
          by the <span>::before</span> psuedo element. From there it is possible
          to set the opacity of the background image.
        </p>

        <p>
            The <span>::before</span> psuedo element creates a layer
            above the parent element, setting the position to absolute
            and giving all sides a value of 0 will prevent the image from
            collapsing/not appearing.
        </p>

           An alternative
        </h1>

        <p>
            An alternative to the first solution is to keep the background 
            image on the parent element and then use the <span>::before</span> psuedo element
            to create an overlay with the color black (0, 0, 0) in rgb in the
            background color and then setting the opacity with the alpha 
            channel, but still keeping the same positioning as
            before.
        </p>

        <p>
            This solution is also helpful if you want to create an overlay
            with a colorful overlay.
