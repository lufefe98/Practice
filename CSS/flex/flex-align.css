    Align items controls where flex items sit on the cross axis
    (ie: Perpendicular to the main axis).
    therefore, if the flex direction is row, then a value of
    align-items that is set to center will align the flex items
    along the vertical axis.

    The defaut for the align-items is stretch, which stretches the
    flex items to fill the parent in the direction of the cross 
    axis.
        - If the parent doesn't have an explicit height set in the
        cross direction, then the flex items will be equal to the
        tallest flex item
    
    The other values for align-items are flex-start (Aligns items
    to the start point of the cross axis) and flex end
    (Aligns items to the end point of the cross axis)

    Align-self overrides the align-items property if a specific
    flex item is targeted.

    /* 
    Justify content controls where the flex items are aligned
    along the main axis.

    The default for justify-content is flex-start
    The above value sorts items out evenly and then gives them
    an equal amount of space on either side.
     NB: Space between is similar to space-around, but differs
     in that it doesn't leave space at either end.
