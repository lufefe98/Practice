# Practice
This repository is for practice.

This repository was made to display any new concepts that I have learnt and practiced to show my understanding of the concepts and making note of my understanding of what I have learnt and practiced.

I also tackle any topics that I may have a limited understanding of and any nuances that I may need refreshing on.
I make sure to leave comments underneath the code where I make note of what I have learnt/discovered.
I also make sure to practice what I have learnt in small mini projects for each respective concept that I learn.
